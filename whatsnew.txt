version: 0.0.2
---------------
* Changed attribute from `__SUBMODULES__` to `__submodules__`. The former is
  still accepted.
* Can now handle attributes defined in if-else and try-except statements as long as they are
  defined on all non-rejecting paths. (Note: a path is rejecting if it is
  unconditionally false or it unconditionally raises an exception)

version: 0.0.1
---------------
* Ported from `ubelt` `0.1.1`
